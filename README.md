# django-bespoke-admin

This package aims to achieve two goals:

1. Allow for the addition of arbitrary views to the Django admin panel; and
2. Create a methodology to allow for [custom management commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/custom-management-commands/) to be executed from the Django admin panel.

**This is still in development. While operational, it is not yet sufficiently abstracted to be usable for all use cases.**

You can install it by: `pip install django-bespoke-admin`
